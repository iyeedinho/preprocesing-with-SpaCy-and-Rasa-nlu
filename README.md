# Preprocesing-with-SpaCy and Rasa_nlu
  * Learning how to use the library spaCy to preprocessing data by :
     1. Reading a document or text
     2. Sentence Tokens
     3. Word Tokens
     4. Speech tagging
     5. Syntactic Dependency
     6. Visualizing dependency using displacy
     7. Lemmatizing
     8. Named Entity Recognition or Detection
     9. Stop Words
     10. Noun Chunks
     11. Sentence segmentation or boundary detection
     12. Loading from my google drive
  
# Intent Classification with Rasa NLU and SpaCy
  * A Libary for intent recognition and entity extraction based on SpaCy and Sklearn
  
*NLP = NLU+NLG*
  * NLP = Natural Language “Processing” (understand,process,interprete everyday human language)
  * NLU = Natural Language “Understanding” (unstructured inputs and convert them into a structured form that a machine can understand and           act upon)
  * NLG = Natural Language “Generation” (responding the same way a human would have by generating artificial text that looks like what a human would have said)
